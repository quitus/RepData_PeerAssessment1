This is an R Markdown document containing the Peer Review Asignment 1 from the Coursera course reproducible Research (repdata-012). 

```{r load data, echo = TRUE}
# Load needed libraries
library(knitr)

# Set the home directory
home <- getwd()

# Load the activity.csv data file. This file should be located in the home directory
data <- read.csv(file.path(home, "activity.csv"))

# Convert the steps data into numeric data
data <- transform(data, steps = as.numeric(steps))

# Total number of steps per day
stepsDay <- aggregate(data$steps, list(date = data$date), sum, na.rm = TRUE)
`````

## 1. Summary table of the steps per day  

The number of total step per day logged from the **activity.csv** file are presented in the following table.
`````{r steps per day table(kable)}
# Print steps per day in a table
kable(stepsDay, format = "html", digits = 2, col.names = c("Date", "Total Steps"), align = c( 1, "c"), caption = "Total number of steps per day")
```
  
## 2. Histogram of the steps per day 
  
The steps per day data can be presented as an histogram. 

```{r steps per day(histogram)}
hist(stepsDay$x, main = "Histogram of the steps per day data", xlab = "Steps per day")
```
  
## 3. Mean and median values of the steps per day  
  
The mean value of the total number of steps taken per day is `r round(mean(stepsDay$x), 3)` while the median value is `r round(median(stepsDay$x), 3)`.
  
## 4. Average number of steps per 5-min interval
  
The average number of steps per 5-min interval is presented in the following plot.  

````{r steps per interval}
# Total number of steps per interval
stepsInterval <- aggregate(data$steps, list(Interval = data$interval), mean, na.rm = TRUE)

plot(stepsInterval$Interval, stepsInterval$x, type = "l", main = "Average daily steps per measurement interval", xlab = "Measurement interval", ylab = "Average number of steps")
````
  
## 5. Maximum period of activity during the 5-min interval  
  
The maximum period of activity among the data happens during the `r stepsInterval[which.max(stepsInterval$x), 1]` interval.  
  
## 6. Total number of missing values

In the original data there are a total of `r sum(is.na(data$steps))` intervals with missing values.  
  
## 7. Replace the missing values  
  
The missing values are replaced with the mean for the 


`````{r replace NA from original data}

`````
